# FCHoneycombMaker
Aids in laying out rectangular array of hexagons to form a honeycomb grid.

When you execute the macro it creates a spreadsheet called "EditMe", a 6-sized regular polygon, which gets extruded into a prism, 2 rectangular areas of said hexagons, and a "plate", which is just a resized cube.
